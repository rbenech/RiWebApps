To do items for web based whiteboard project wb.html:                     (1/18/2012 oer)

-TreePane is using dijit.Tree but has these issues:
  1. needs to do on-click for 'non-leaf' nodes
  2. needs to expand the top level node by one level upon initial creation
  
-ListPane is currently using html list <ul>. Issues:
  1. It has no concept of 'selected item'.
  2. Currently using TreePane in its place right now.

-TextPane is using an html 'textarea' but has the following issues:
  1. If do any typing in there, that panel can no longer be updated (needs to be able to 'clear' that).
  2. 

-Connection to server only happens on initial load, with fallback from webSocket to polling. Issues are:
  1. Websocket times out at 3min. Either need a keep-alive ping or else a reconnect scheme.
  2. Anytime the connection is lost, webSocket should be tried first then polling. That way if a server is restarted that supports Websocket, the connection will auto-upgrade.
  3. Currently the app checks only whether the browser supports Websocket. If the Server does not support it this is not well handled.
  4. At some point should just disable polling option? (prob. would need additional effort for our basic polling scheme to scale to a larger type application). 
  
-wbSmParse:
  1. When get createSubscriber: needs to open a new window with a new SM channel instead of the current scheme which replaces the existing.
  2.
    
-Menus: need to be implemented. Both top level pull-down as well as right-click context.
-Dialogs: need to be implemented.
-TurtlePanel: needs to be implemented (most likely using SVG).
-Radio buttons don't display properly in Firefox
-wbUtil: do some caching on the SM headers emit instead of rebuilding the whole thing each time?
-Look into using JQuery instead of Dojo.
