To do items for web based whiteboard project wb.html:    (6/3/2012 oer)

-Background fetch: 
	-put the objects in a set to limit mutiple fetches of same file.
	-Do an attributes query for the file instead of objRetrieve. Only fetch if newer
	-do something about KV, KR type queries as well

-Get rid of [object Object] in panels. Make rawSm and sm servlets work same way

-fix PanelPane (broken since Whiteboard object was added):
  TODO: RtWidget_PanelPane needs to make a TurtlePanel object with itself as the parent. note: The only callback is 'emitSmEvent'.

-Do unsubscribe when windows close 

-Fix it so web wb it doesn't respond when java wb does a subscribe

-Implement Dialogs

-Implement Menus: Both top level pull-down as well as right-click context.

-Elim broadcasts and do src<->dst reversal instead

-Finish ListPane. Currently using html list <ul>. Issues:
  o It has no concept of 'selected item'.
  o Currently using TreePane in its place right now.

-TextPane is using an html 'textarea' but has the following issues:
  o If do any typing in there, that panel can no longer be updated (needs to be able to 'clear' that).

-Connection to server, with fallback from webSocket to polling. Issues are:
  o Currently the app checks only whether the browser supports Websocket. If the Server does not support it this is not well handled.
  o At some point should just disable polling option? (prob. would need additional effort for our basic polling scheme to scale to a larger type application). 

-wbUtil: do some caching on the SM headers emit instead of rebuilding the whole thing each time?
